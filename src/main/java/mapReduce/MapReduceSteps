1) Get Data
2) Split up Data
3) Send Data to nodes and map
	-Works start asking for data
	-Only give data for current mapper
4) Get mapped data back
	-Workers send maps back
	-As get maps back, give to dispatcher to combine
5) Combine mapped data
6) Send mapped data to nodes and reduce
	-Workers start asking for mapped data
	-Only give mapped data for current reducer
7) Get reduced data back
	-Workers send reduced data back
	-As get maps back, give to dispatcher to combine
8) Save reduced data (not sure how to save it)
	-Tell workers to delete mapper and reducer implementation files
	-Save one file with all key value pairs
9) Send results to person who asked for data to be processed (if they left an address to send to)
